# Bubbles
Bubbles is a virtual AI which is currently under development and open to contributions from community. 
Bubbles can perform tasks like other virtual assistants. Plus, adding a speech recognition facility for the commercial product.
I aim to develop it as a virtual assistance with vast functionalities and tool for UI developers to create a UI app (currently angular) as user types or talks.
